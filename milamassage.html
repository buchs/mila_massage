            <b>Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD)</b> is a very gentle light
            massage that helps to direct lymphatic fluid towards the lymph
            nodes. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system and cleans
            toxins, proteins, cancer cells, viruses, and dead cells about 20
            times faster than the body is able to do on it's own. Once a large
            amount of toxins are eliminated, the body is able to relax more
            deeply and use it's energy more directly to regenerate the cells.
            People have been known to lose weight and have increased energy
            level. It improves the healing process after surgery as well as
            reduction in edema (swelling) and scarring, MLD also reduces
            symptoms of fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid
            arthritis and migrains. It is an excellent technique for post
            liposuction surgery and plastic surgery patients. <br /><span

            <b>Deep Tissue</b> is designed to remove severe tension. It is a
            technique used to relieve both muscles and connective tissue below
            the surface. It helps to improve range of motion and heal injuries
            below the surface. Deep tissue massage is often recommended for
            individuals who experience consistent pain, are involved in heavy
            physical activity, such as athletes, and patients who have sustained
            physical injury.<br /><br />

            It is also not uncommon for receivers of Deep Tissue Massage to have
            their pain replaced with a new muscle ache for a day or two. Deep
            tissue work varies greatly. What one calls deep tissue another will
            call light. When receiving deep tissue work it is important to
            communicate what you are feeling.<br /><br />

            If you have pain in certain area of your body and would like a deep
            tissue massage, and also haven't had a massage for more then 2
            months I would recommend to book a 90 min session to receive enough
            focus on the troubled area and also enjoy a full body massage to
            benefit from your session the most.

            <b>Swedish Massage</b> uses massage oil or cream and smooth, gliding
            strokes. It uses firm but gentle pressure to promote relaxation,
            ease muscle tension and create other health benefits. It is a
            classic massage that will ease your stress and allow you to slip
            into a calm state of relaxation. <br /><span

            <b>Sports Massage</b> uses a variety of massage techniques designed
            to help your body feel freer and stronger. It is particularly great
            for those with active lifestyles. <br /><span

            <b>Hot Stone Massage</b> uses smooth stones which are heated and
            then lubricated with oil or essential oils. The therapeutic effects
            of heat are used to relax muscles more deeply. Used as an extension
            of the therapistâ€™s hands, massage stones induce deep relaxation and
            provide a unique experience many find to be tremendously calming and
            centering. <br /><span class="btn btn-secondary p-0"

            <b>Pregnancy Massage</b> focuses on addressing the special needs of
            expecting women. Side-lying postures are used to prevent putting
            pressure on the abdomen. Goals of the therapy are the same as
            regular massage (relaxation, pain relief, increased circulation &
            mobility, etc.). However, due to the changes undergone during
            pregnancy, modification are made. To accommodate swollen tender
            breasts and a growing belly, special pillows, positioning and
            techniques are utilized to ensure comfort for both the expecting
            mother and baby. With increasing weight, a changing center of
            gravity and the many other changes associated with pregnancy,
            prenatal massage can help provide relief and a sense of well being
            that is much deserved.<br /><span class="btn btn-secondary p-0"

          <li>
            <b>Chair Massage</b> is performed in a specially designed chair with
            your clothes on. It is excellent for relaxation and more, depending
            on the technique(s) used by your massage therapist. <br /><span
              class="btn btn-secondary p-0"
              >$50 for 30min or $75 for 60min</span

          <li>
            <b>Reiki</b> uses a technique commonly called palm or hands on
            healing. Through the use of this technique, practitioners transfer
            universal energy (i.e., reiki) in the form of qi (Japanese: ki)
            through the palms, which they believe allows for self-healing and a
            state of equilibrium. <br /><span class="btn btn-secondary p-0"

          <li>
            <b>Trigger Point Therapy</b> focuses on trigger points which are
            described as hyperirritable spots in skeletal muscles that are
            associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers.
            Trigger point practitioners believe that palpable nodules are small
            contraction knots[ambiguous] and a common cause of pain. The trigger
            point model states that unexplained pain frequently radiates from
            these points of local tenderness to broader areas, sometimes distant
            from the trigger point itself. Practitioners claim to have
            identified reliable referred pain patterns, allowing practitioners
            to associate pain in one location with trigger points elsewhere.<br />
